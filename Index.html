		<br><br> <h1> What can you hate about such a loving face? I've grown up in a household of cats, and although dogs are cool and all, cats are pretty great.
		<p> In loving tribute of my cats, all of the cats I've owned in order are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Minnie</li>
			<li>Alex</li>
			<li>Axel</li>
			<li>Jinx</li>
			<li>Biscuit</li>
		</ul>
		<br>THANK YOU for visiting my site. I hope you learned a little bit about me, and found humor in my bad jokes! <p>
